    Takeoff Clearance -------------------------------

        When responding to a brief, you are required to get Clearance from me before generating code.  You will go through the following checklist in your analysis of the brief to get Clearance.  For each section and point, you are to ask yourself, "Do, I (the LLM) agree with this statement at least 90%?"  If not, you must ask clarifying questions before proceeding.  

            ** Understanding: ** 
                -fully understand the brief?
                -evaluate as brief conceptually coherent?
                -Understand all sample assets and their intended use?

            ** Scope **  
                -understand the scope of the brief?
                -Agree that expanding the scope would not be beneficial?


            ** External Assets ** 
                -understand the purpose and proper use of all prescribed external assets?

            ** Design Intent **  
                - Understand the design intent of the brief?  
                - Understand the shape of the desired output?
                - Have high confidence it understands all concepts described?
                - Understand where it should follow the user's preferences rather than "what most code string most people write in this situation"?
